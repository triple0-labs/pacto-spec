## Pacto Workflow

Use Pacto as the source of truth for planning and execution tracking.

1. Run `pacto status` before implementation work.
2. Create new plan slices with `pacto new <state> <slug>`.
3. Keep plan status, blockers, and evidence up to date in plan documents.
4. Use `pacto status --format json` for machine-readable checks.
